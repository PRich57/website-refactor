# Website Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to take code written by another person and refactor it in a way that fixes bugs and improves accessibility. The starter code was written well enough to create a mostly functioning webpage, although it contained no semantic elements, alt tags for images, or comments. The CSS file had redundancies with multiple elements containing the exact same properties and values, which have since been consolidated where appropriate. This lesson taught us how to read and understand existing code, how to refactor that code, what constitutes an accessible webpage, how to efficiently use CSS by having us consolidate and reorganize wherever possible, and how to comment in both HTML and CSS.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This page is essentially only for viewing the included content. The functional features that can be used are at the top of the page in the navigation bar. To use the navigation bar, click on any of the three main topics on the right side of the blue bar that runs across the top of your screen. These topics are links that, when clicked, will take you to the portion of the webpage that contains information related to the that topic.

## Mock-Up
